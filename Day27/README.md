### Day 27 continues work on error handling.

I don't have a specific project that I'm working on and the rock, paper, scissors app only has a few fail points.  

In the spirit of error handling though, I figured I would look for some common python errors.  

[Invent with Python](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/07/09/16-common-python-runtime-errors-beginners-find/) had a great article with plenty of examples.  

Another great resource that I found was over at [python-textbook](https://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/Errors_and_Exceptions.html) where they go into further detail on handling various errors.
