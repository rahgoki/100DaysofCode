### Day 48!

Today, I searched for additional web scraping resources instead of potentially repeating the same exercise; just on a different site.  

Basic [intro](https://gist.github.com/bradmontgomery/1872970) that is very similar to what we've done.  The difference is in what type of information is being scraped.  This mainly highlights other uses of beautiful soup and requests. 

A slightly different method for creating a virtual [environmnet](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-on-macos) than the previous resource. 

This [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-work-with-web-data-using-requests-and-beautiful-soup-with-python-3) goes into a little more depth.
