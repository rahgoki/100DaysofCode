### Day 41! 

I watched additional videos on JSON, but decided to work on a decision tree using sklearn with the rest of my time today.  I didn't get that far with it, but progress was made.  

That repo is [here](https://github.com/rahgoki/TelcoChurn). 

The tutorial that was used can be found [here](https://medium.com/@rnbrown/creating-and-visualizing-decision-trees-with-python-f8e8fa394176)
