### DAY 31!  Today is all about logging.

Using [logbook](https://logbook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), we can write important messages easily to a text file for future use.  Hopefully, most of these will simply sit out there as a reference if needed.  If something goes wrong though, it's nice to have log files and having a library that makes creating them easily is nice!
