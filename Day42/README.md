### Day 42!

Today I worked on the decision tree classifier a little further.  The tree now has class lables, better split and accuracy accounted for.  Thus far each model has performed in the 75-83% accuracy range.  

The link to that repo is [here](https://github.com/rahgoki/TelcoChurn).  It will be an ongoing project for sure.
