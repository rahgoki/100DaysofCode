### Day 50!  Officially half way!

I'm not currently working on a specific project to run cProfile on, so here is a lit of other performance related resources!


* Timeit [docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/timeit.html).
* This [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/library/timeit.html) lists a few performance items.  Memory profiler and line profiler are interesting.
