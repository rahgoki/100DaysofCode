### I changed it up a little today and worked on a different track.  

I created a new [repo](https://github.com/rahgoki/PimaIndianDiabetes) where I worked on the Pima Indian dataset to predict diabetes.  It was mostly an XGBoost tutorial, but since it was a binary classfication problem - I added logistic regression on at the end.
