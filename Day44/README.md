### Day 44!  

Today was a short modification of [yesterday](https://github.com/rahgoki/100DaysofCode/tree/master/Day43). The Google Map API, in this context at least, doesn't return any data.  Their API is widely used though and nice to be familiar with. 

Some of the resources that is used:

* Talkpython movie search [service](http://movie_service.talkpython.fm).
* Postman [app](https://www.getpostman.com).
* Requests library [docs](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/).
* Additional [resource](https://realpython.com/api-integration-in-python/) for Python and API's.
* Google [docs](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/urls/guide) for their simple Maps URLs.
