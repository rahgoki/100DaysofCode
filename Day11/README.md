### We've made it to day 11!  

---
Today we're continuing with testing.  Cpt Jimmy Kirk had a quick [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwG656XIa40) on using [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-4.5.1a/)  We linked to a coverage test library yesterday, but today we're looking at another.  I liked this one a little better as it's input was easier and the HTML output was nice..
