### Day 25!  

Days 25 - 28 are all about error handling.  Back on [Day 15](https://github.com/rahgoki/100DaysofCode/tree/master/Day15) I started a simple rock, paper, scissors game.  I added some lazy error handling which basically was if statement that exited the game if anything it wasn't expecting was entered.  

We can do a little better than that!  Today if an error is caught, the game continues after a generic error message is produced.
